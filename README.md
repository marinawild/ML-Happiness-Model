This is my machine learning lab for Break Through Tech: UCLA where I was provided a World Happiness dataset and then trained and built my own model for predicting whether people are happy or unhappy depending on different features. I first analyzed and prepped the data, removing features that were not important to the efficiency of my model and also replacing missing values. I tested two models out to determine whcih one would be best. I tried Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and decided my Random Forest model was the best route to take.

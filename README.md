This is my machine learning lab for Break Through Tech: UCLA where I was provided a World Happiness dataset and then trained and built my own model for predicting whether people are happy or unhappy depending on different features. I first analyzed and prepped the data, removing features that were not important to the efficiency of my model and also replacing missing values. I tested two models out to determine which one would be best. I tried Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and decided my Random Forest model was the best route to take. In the near future, I would love to change and enhance a couple of things. I would like to go back and replace some of the mssing values with the mean value from each country, rather than the mean value of the whole column. I would also like to have more categories of predictions rather than just Unhappy or Happy, because happiness is on a scale and I would like the model to predict based on that scale.
